# DataPipelineBuilderAndReviewer
The Data Pipeline Builder &amp; Reviewer Agent is an AI-powered assistant designed to automate the creation and review of data processing pipelines.

Users provide high-level, natural language instructions—such as “Create a Spark job that reads JSON logs from S3, filters only error logs, aggregates counts per hour, and loads results into Redshift”—and the agent generates clean, production-ready PySpark code.
